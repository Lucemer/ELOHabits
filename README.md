A program that allows users to develop habits by competing in personal proximal development.
Habit Game Tracker is a gamified habit-building desktop app. You define your own habits and their performance parameters (e.g., for WorkingOut: nr. of pushups, squats, kilometers biked, etc.). 

You compete against a randomly generated adversary whose performance is based on your past results, with an ELO-style rating system to keep things competitive and motivating.

Features
Custom Habits: Define any habit and set your own performance parameters and weights.

Adversary System: Each session, face a randomly generated adversary whose score is based on your history and chosen difficulty.

ELO Rating: Win, or lose points based on your performance versus the adversary, using a chess-style ELO system.

Difficulty Levels: Choose from Easy, Normal, or Hard adversary ranges.

Session History: Each habit keeps a CSV log of your sessions, scores, and rating changes.

GUI: User-friendly interface built with Tkinter.

Portable Executable: Package the app as a standalone Windows executable.
