# ELOHabits: Habit Game Tracker

ELOHabits is a gamified habit tracker (though 'tracking' is not yet an actually implemented feature ðŸ˜…) that uses a simplified ELO-like rating system (think, League of Legends) to help you build and maintain habits. Challenge yourself with generated adversaries, and climb the rating ladder of your own habit.

## Features

- **Gamified Habit Tracking:** Each habit has a rating and rank, inspired by competitive games.
- **Custom Parameters:** Define your own parameters and weights for each habit.
- **Adversary Generation:** Challenge yourself with AI-generated adversary scores based on your history and chosen difficulty.
- **Data Persistence:** All data is stored in a local SQLite database.
- **Backup & Restore:** Easily backup or restore your habit data with ZIP files.
- **Icon & Description Support:** Personalize habits with icons and descriptions.
